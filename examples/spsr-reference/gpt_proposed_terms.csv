Return Year,The calendar year in which adult salmon return to their natal freshwater spawning habitat.,https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/salmon-saumon/gloss-eng.html,owl_class,https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon#YearBasis,broader: YearBasis,Complements BroodYear and CatchYear as temporal reference frame
Age-Location-Stratified Catch,Number of individuals caught or observed in a specific age class at a specific spatial location (mainstem ocean or terminal).,New term for SPSR,skos_concept,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/individualCount,broader: individualCount; constraint: age class + spatial stratum,I-ADOPT needs constraint_iri for age and location. Covers MAINSTEM_AGE_X OCEAN_AGE_X TERMINAL_AGE_X pattern
Marine Survival Rate,Proportion of juvenile salmon that survive their ocean residence period and return as adults.,https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/,skos_concept,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C25337,broader: survival rate; entity: juvenile salmon; phase: marine,Related to MARINE_SURVIVAL_INDEX column
Proportion Hatchery-Origin Spawners,The proportion of spawning adults in a population that originated from hatchery production rather than natural spawning.,https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.928944/publication.html,skos_concept,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C25337,property: proportion; entity: spawners; constraint: hatchery origin,Related to pHOS column. Ratio of hatchery to wild spawners
In-River Mortality Rate,The proportion of a salmon population that dies during freshwater migration before reaching spawning grounds.,New term for SPSR,skos_concept,,broader: mortality rate; entity: salmon; phase: freshwater migration; constraint: pre-spawning,Distinct from mainstem terminal and ocean mortality. Occurs during river migration phase
Mainstem Mortality Rate,The proportion of fish that die while migrating through the mainstem river channel before reaching spawning grounds.,New term for SPSR,skos_concept,,broader: mortality rate; entity: salmon; location: mainstem; phase: migration; constraint: pre-spawning,Specific to main river channel mortality
Ocean Mortality Rate,The proportion of fish that die while at sea due to natural causes such as predation disease starvation or environmental conditions.,New term for SPSR,skos_concept,,broader: mortality rate; entity: salmon; location: ocean; phase: marine residence,Covers natural mortality during ocean phase excluding fishing
Terminal Mortality Rate,The proportion of fish that die in the terminal area near spawning grounds before they can spawn.,New term for SPSR,skos_concept,,broader: mortality rate; entity: salmon; location: terminal area; phase: pre-spawning,Terminal areas are rivers or estuaries near spawning grounds
Run Reconstruction Expansion Factor,A scalar multiplier used to scale observed catch numbers to estimate total run size in a fishery management area.,New term for SPSR,skos_concept,,,Accounts for unobserved components of population. Used in PFMA run reconstruction
Gilbert-Rich Age Convention,Age determination convention for Pacific salmon where age is expressed as European_age.Freshwater_age (e.g. 1.3 means 1 year in freshwater 3 years total).,https://www.npafc.org/,owl_class,,alternative: European Age Convention,Standard aging method for Pacific salmon
European Age Convention,Age determination convention where age is total years since hatching.,https://www.npafc.org/,owl_class,,alternative: Gilbert-Rich Age Convention,Simpler aging convention expressing total age
